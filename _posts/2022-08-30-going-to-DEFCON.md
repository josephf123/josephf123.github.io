This is a quick writeup of when I got to go to DEFCON and Blackhat in August 2022.

As I was really starting to become more interested in cybersecurity, earlier in 2022 I started to look at some of the figures of this field.

Richard Buckland had got me started in this field, as the head of the Cybersecurity department at UNSW and really got me started in this field

At my university in Australia, one of my teachers for Web Application Security was @abhijeth coincidentally was speaking at Blackhat 2022 while I was going to be America, after speaking to him, he was able to help me get someone to sponsor me to go to DEFCON
