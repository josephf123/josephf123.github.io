Going back to that thing about if shitty people do it, you can really see it’s true shape.

Satire is somewhere which over exaggerates something to really see it’s structure

I just saw a poster of bear grills looking into the distance “never give up”. This shit is so corny but reveals the true structure of something which might be harder to see in another poster which conceals this fact better

The broader theory you're proposing is that certain forms of expression, especially those that are unrefined, exaggerated, or even poorly executed, can paradoxically provide clearer insight into the underlying truth or structure of an idea than more polished or sophisticated expressions. This is because the lack of refinement or the over-the-top nature of these expressions strips away any pretense or obfuscation, laying bare the core of the matter.

1. Going to a comedy show and watching the comedians perform. Looking at the bad ones it is very obvious to see the structure of their joke, they make jokes on low hanging fruit. As you get better as a comedian, the comedian is able to hide away this structure as they are more smooth, you don't even realise that you are walking through their joke.

2. When looking at kids interacting socially. It is very obvious the power dynamics, one kid has a crush on another, doing things to impress the others. I argue that as adults we are pretty much the same but we are much better at hiding these things, this is because we have learnt how to hide these things

In the first example, you mention that during a comedy show, the structure of a joke is more apparent when performed by a less skilled comedian. They tend to rely on obvious or low-hanging fruit, making the setup and punchline more predictable. In contrast, more experienced comedians can craft their jokes in a way that obscures the underlying structure, making the humor feel more natural and less contrived.
The second example focuses on the social interactions of children. You point out that the power dynamics, crushes, and attempts to impress others are more transparent in children's interactions. However, as people grow older and become adults, they learn to conceal these underlying motivations and dynamics, making them less obvious to observers.
These examples reinforce your theory that the true nature or structure of something can be more easily identified in its simpler, less refined forms. When people are less skilled at concealing the underlying structure, whether it's in the form of a poorly constructed joke or the straightforward social interactions of children, the core elements become more apparent.
As individuals gain experience and sophistication, they learn to hide these fundamental structures, making it more challenging to discern the true nature of their actions or creations. This masking of the underlying framework can be seen in various aspects of life, from social interactions to artistic expressions and beyond.
Your theory suggests that by examining the less polished or more transparent examples of a given phenomenon, we can gain valuable insights into its true essence. The "shitty" examples, as you mentioned earlier, serve as a window into the core structure that may be obscured in more refined manifestations.
This perspective encourages a deeper analysis of the basic forms of expression and interaction, as they may hold the key to understanding the fundamental nature of complex systems and behaviors.

Political discourse:
In the realm of politics, less experienced or less polished politicians may make arguments that clearly reveal their biases, agendas, or logical fallacies. More seasoned politicians, on the other hand, have learned to craft their messages in a way that obscures these underlying motivations, making their arguments seem more convincing or neutral.

Brecht's idea was that theater should not seek to create an illusion of reality that emotionally engages the audience, but rather, it should deliberately remind the audience that they are watching a play. By doing so, the audience is encouraged to think critically about the social and political issues being presented on stage, rather than getting swept up in the story and characters.

Best examples:

- kids interacting at the playground (even highschool)
- smart people debating vs dumb people debating (they are both using the same logic of mind is flat)
